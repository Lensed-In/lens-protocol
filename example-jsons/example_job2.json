We are currently developing the hole smart contract ecosystem to be the number 1 platform when it comes to NFT leverage. Holders can keep and maintain their NFT perks, to allow them to continue to use their NFTs while also using them as collateral. Weâ€™re supported by well-known venture funds and are currently finishing our testnet launch. This is a remote position (Europe to Asia) with travel opportunities and the chance to work on an innovative DeFixNFT project, currently at the frontline of this new space.",
